# Data Analysis and Mapping of Marine Flatfishes 
This repository contains R scripts for analyzing and mapping the distribution of Summer Flounder (*Paralichthys dentatus*) and Tonguefish (*Symphurus plagiusa*) in the Chesapeake Bay over the past fifty years. The analysis uses data from iDigBio and sediment information to understand potential effects of climate change on fish burial behavior. 
This was the final presentation we made: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGLUn8l7v0/RK2S2XyY1IsElqZINk4pDg/edit?utm_content=DAGLUn8l7v0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
## Requirements 
To run the scripts, you need to install the following R packages: 
- `ridigbio`
-  `sp`
- `raster`
- `sf`
- `ggplot2`
You can install these packages using the following R commands:

 ```r
install.packages("ridigbio")
install.packages("sp")
install.packages("raster")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("ggplot2")
